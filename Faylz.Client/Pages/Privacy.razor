                <h2>Our Privacy Commitment</h2>
                <p>
                    At Faylz, we take your privacy extremely seriously. Our core philosophy is built around respecting
                    your data and ensuring that your files remain completely private.
                </p>

                <h2>How Our Tools Work</h2>
                <p>
                    All of our tools operate entirely within your web browser. When you use Faylz:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your files are processed locally on your device</li>
                    <li>Your files are NEVER uploaded to our servers</li>
                    <li>We have no access to your files or their contents</li>
                    <li>No file data is stored or cached on our end</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>The contents of your files</li>
                    <li>The names of your files</li>
                    <li>The types of tools you use</li>
                    <li>Personal information (unless explicitly provided)</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Information We May Collect</h2>
                <p>
                    We collect minimal anonymous usage data to help us improve our service:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Anonymous usage statistics (page views, tool usage counts)</li>
                    <li>Anonymous technical information (browser type, operating system)</li>
                    <li>Crash reports (without personal identifiers)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    This information is collected in aggregate form only and cannot be used to identify you personally.
                </p>

                <h2>Cookies</h2>
                <p>
                    We use a minimal set of cookies that are necessary for the application to function. 
                    These cookies do not track you across websites and are used only to:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Remember your preferences</li>
                    <li>Maintain your session state</li>
                    <li>Improve site performance</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
                <p>
                    We do not use third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services. We believe that such
                    services often compromise user privacy, which goes against our core values.
                </p>

                <h2>Data Security</h2>
                <p>
                    Since we don't store your files or personal data on our servers, there is minimal risk
                    of data breaches affecting your files. All processing happens locally in your browser's
                    secure sandbox environment.
                </p>

                <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
                <p>
                    Our service is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect
                    personal information from children under 13.
                </p>

                    We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes
                    by posting the new privacy policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date.
